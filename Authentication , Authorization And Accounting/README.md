# CompTIA Security+ (Professor Messer) â€“ Learning Journey

## Video Title: Authentication,Authorization And Accounting

### ðŸ“Œ Summary
Our IT systems works on a framework knowm as AAA framework (Authentication,Authorization And Accounting). This framework provides us
the basic fundamental security practice. Authentication works by first identifying the user by taking their credentials then after taking
credentials it is then matched to authenticate the user by comparing it.After sucessful authentication the next big thing is authorization
which means what access do you have and will get in the system? but the problem is scalabilty . In real world ,we deal with hundreds
thousands of users and manually assigning each account their access policy is simply impossible so organizations uses a authorization
model which adds up an abstraction by creating a group of resources so when assigning access policy we simply add the user to that group.
In the last, Accounting means logging the every bit of information from logging into account till logging out from account. 


### Key Concepts Learned
- AAA framework
- Identity and Access management
- Authorization model
- Certificate Authority For Authentication

### Important Terms
- **Authentication** â€“ To ensure the user is geniune and as intended.
- **Authorization** â€“ To control and decide who has what access in the system.  
- **Accounting** â€“ Logging the every bit of information. 

### ðŸ’¡ My Takeaway
AAA Framework helps us to maintain the security and scalabilty of the systems.
