# CompTIA Security+ (Professor Messer) â€“ Learning Journey

## Video Title: Non-Repudiation

### ðŸ“Œ Summary
Non-repudiation includes proof of integrity and origin. In cryptography, we use digital signatures to ensure integrity and origin of data.


### Key Concepts Learned
- Cyptography
- How the creation of digital signatures works in the backend?

### Important Terms
- **Proof Of Integrity** â€“ To verify that data that is recived is not corrupt and unchanged.
- **Proof Of Origin** â€“ To ensure that data is coming from the intened user(sender).  
- **Primary key** â€“ An special key used by sender to perform encryption on data.
- **Public key** â€“ An special key used by reciver to perform decryption on the recieved data.  

### ðŸ’¡ My Takeaway
Ensuring the data is genuine and coming from the intended side is one of the critical things in the security of a system and
cryptography helps us in ensuring the integrity and orginality of the data.
